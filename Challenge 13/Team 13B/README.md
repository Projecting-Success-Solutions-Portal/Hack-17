# Challenge Summary

With 80% of 2050 building stock already existing today, we must prioritise decarbonising what we already have. After it is built, the majority of emissions associated with a building are related to on-site energy consumption. Measuring and controlling the carbon emission of buildings in operation can present itself with a range of challenges. However, occupiers need to understand their CO2 emission to provide reliable CO2 reporting and achieve net zero goals. We want to provide a solution that measures operational carbon emission and understands the impact the behaviour of occupiers can have.
