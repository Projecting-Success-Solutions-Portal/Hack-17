**Extreme Weather Optimisation Tool**

2025 PDA Vision Theme: Planning, Monitoring and Control

Type:
Student friendly

Tools Used – Visualisation, Data Analysis, Optimisation

**Summary**

-

With 80% of 2050 building stock already existing today, we must prioritise decarbonising what we already have. After it is built, the majority of emissions associated with a building are related to on-site energy consumption.
Measuring and controlling the carbon emission of buildings in operation can present itself with a range of challenges. However, occupiers need to understand their CO2 emission to provide reliable CO2 reporting and achieve net zero goals. We want to provide a solution that measures operational carbon emission and understands the impact the behaviour of occupiers can have.

**Pain Points**

-
- There is no automated solution to measuring and reporting on CO2 emission related to building usage
- There is no automated solution that provides reliable CO2 emissions data on a monthly/quarterly/yearly basis to track progress and the impact of initiatives
- There is no understanding of what impact a user has on the carbon emission of a building
- It is unclear what impact energy saving technologies have if the users aren’t using them correctly (caused by lack of knowledge or lack of willingness)
- There is no tool to assess how technology and humans work together to lower CO2 emission

**User Stories**

- As an occupier I want to know the CO2 emission of my building so that I can provide environmental reporting to my investors, clients and other stakeholders.
  As an occupier I want to understand what is causing CO2 emission so that I can identify areas to tackle for introducing energy saving actions (technology or process driven).
  As an occupier I want to understand the energy consumption of my building and the areas that cause it to identify cost saving opportunities.
  As an occupier I want to understand what impact human interaction with the building has so that I can make decisions on investments and assess the impact those investments will realistically have.
  As an occupier I want all of my steps to be repeatable (building data collection and user survey) so that I can run reports on a regular basis and reuse process/documents in the future.

  **Context**

  - Gleeds is a world-class independent property and construction consultancy with over 135 years’ experience. Gleeds vision is to create a business that attracts the very best clients, projects and people in the industry. The service is based on combining over 135 years of expertise and experience in new ways that make a genuine difference to projects. Through an entrepreneurial and flexible approach, Gleeds is prepared to look outside of the norm to find the perfect answer.
    Gleeds recognises that all activities can impact on the environment both locally and globally and acknowledges the need for responsible action in this area. They are committed to minimising any adverse impact on the environment and seek to continuously improve their environmental performance. They ensure all employees are equipped with the knowledge, skills and awareness in this area.
    Gleeds are currently focussed on collecting consistent information globally enabling reporting against newly adopted Global Reporting Initiative Indicators (GRI). Gleeds has created an embodies carbon calculator that provides building planners and investors with information about the embodies carbon of a new building. The calculator helps making resource-saving decisions and lowering CO2 emissions of buildings. Gleeds is now looking to track similar information about buildings in operation. They want to find out what happens to a building after it’s been taken into operation. This involves data gathering of CO2 emissions and information tracking of anything that is influencing that data. Hand in hand with this goes understanding the human impact on energy consumption and efficient use of buildings. An occupier can then set realistic targets, identify actions to achieve those targets and measuring change.

    **Output**

    1. Visualisation of the carbon emissions data including emissions sources, highlighting levers for potential emissions savings. Ideally a tool, system or platform would be created that provides information to occupiers and with which they can share information with stakeholders

2. Presentation of the user survey with explanation of why certain questions are asked
3. Using self-created dummy data, analysis of how humans can increase or lower CO2 emission, including an assessment of user knowledge & willingness to comply with energy saving actions

**Benefit**
• Occupiers will be able to understand what initiatives can have what impact on cost savings and emissions reduction
• A reliable source of information can quantify the impact of cultural change on CO2 emission
• Occupiers will be able to receive reliable information for their CO2 reporting

# Dataset Description

A dataset will be provided entailing information on CO2 emission and emission sources of a Gleeds building in operation.
Consider what additional data may be useful or necessary for any proposals you make. Maybe open source datasets can be helpful for this challenge.
You will have to create your own dummy data for the survey you are creating to provide insights into how human behaviour is impacting CO2 reduction or emission increase.
