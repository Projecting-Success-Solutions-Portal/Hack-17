# Challenge #14

**Risk Management Insight**

2025 PDA Vision Theme: Risk Management

**Summary**

Risk Management is necessary in all projects large or small in order to ensure that any potential problems within a project are accounted for and any necessary steps are taken in order to mitigate that risk. At HS2 there are large portfolios of projects happening at any one time. We want to ensure that risks management is at the heart of the programme execution as part of the visions of 2025 but also to ensure the process is robust and resilience.

Can insights on existing risk registers provide a view on how risks are identified and managed and also provide recommendations on process improvement to ensure that projects are delivered on time, on budget and to the highest possible standard?

**Pain Points**

- Ensuring the team is engaged and informed on their risk management
- Education on the impact of incomplete assigned risk response action
- Socialisation of the risk impact analysis or reports across the wider organisation to encourage engagement
- Learning lessons from historical risk data
- Developing global risk registers, risk catalogues and learning from existing risks
- Minimising the number of redundant risks and decreasing time spend to produce risks
- Improving the quality of risk information within the risk register database

**User Stories**

- As a Risk Manager, I want to ensure the risk management process is efficient and improve confidence in our risk capturing techniques, this will ensure that the key risks are identified, captured, assigned and monitored in a timely manner.

- As a Risk Owner, I want to ensure my risk is receiving appropriate attention, so that the likelihood of it being realised, and its impact, is minimised.

- As a Project Manager, I want confidence that all risks are being identified and managed, so that the project plan can be delivered on time, on budget and to the highest quality possible.

- As a Senior Decision Maker, I want to understand how risks are being managed and see data that gives confidence in the quality of our risk assessments, so that I can intervene when needed to ensure all projects are delivered with resilience.

- As a Contractor, I want to understand what risks have been identified in the project, and benchmarked against similar or historic projects, so that I can take all the necessary precautions to ensure delivery.

**Context**

HS2 is the UK’s flagship transport levelling up project. It is the biggest rail investment ever made in the North of England and is Europe’s largest infrastructure project. Major civil engineering works are now underway with £23 billion contracted into the supply chain and over 350 active sites between the West Midlands and London, supporting 27,000 jobs, delivering benefits before a single train has started running. The new high-speed line will run between the North West and the South East, stopping at Manchester, Birmingham and London with trains continuing on the existing network to Scotland and elsewhere.

HS2 contains a substantial number of ongoing projects, in order to manage the complex and interconnected project plan a significant number of risks must be managed as well. Within the risk team there is constant need to tracking review and workshopping risk for all aspects of projects in order to ensure the greatest resilience possible.

In this challenge we are asking teams to review, explore and analyse the risk data from HS2 in order to improve quality and reduce the burden on the risk management team. There are a number of ways you could approach this challenge and you will be unlikely to be able to achieve all the goals of the challenge in the Hack timeframe, so make sure to focus primarily on one specific area.

The first approach to this challenge is to recognise how well risk is identified and captured. We want you to identify how well the data describes the root cause and impact/consequences of the risk, i.e., is the risk information robust enough to pinpoint the inherent threats / opportunities?

The second approach is risk catalogues. How can we ensure that lessons are learned from risk, and how can we use past risk data to create resilience for future projects?

The third approach is more conceptual. How can we improve the risk process using the data as a guide? How can risk cataloguing data quality be improved, and how can it be used to improve risk management?

You can tackle this challenge however you want, whether that is visualising insights or using machine learning to determine contributing factors to realisation. We want to know how good our risk management is, how to improve it and how to optimize.

**Dataset Description**

A series of closed risks recorded from two business units. This includes a detailed description of the risk and its consequences, as well as a ranked impact ranging from very low to very high.

**Outputs**

The output for this challenge is very open ended. A visualisation of the results of your analysis should be included but feel free to present this as you like. What we want primarily is an understanding of the performance of each risk item evidenced with the data. We also want to understand the impact of a delayed risk and the likelihood of the risk being realised against the project objectives or milestones not being achieved. We also want to understand the quality of our risks and how to identify a good risk and a bad risk.

Beyond that we want teams to think about how risks can be catalogued in order to ensure that risks are not being missed on a new project. How can we compare previous risks to future projects? A risk catalogue system could be the direction you take this challenge.

Lastly, is there any insight the data provides into the risk management process? How can we improve how risks are managed in the future?

Feel free to use machine learning for your output if you think it would bring additional value.

**Benefits**

As with any data analysis, the benefits are not necessarily clear from the start. However, there are a number of potential benefits that could be achieved if the pain points are met.

It would bring improved decision-making power supported by evidence. It would improve project delivery, safety and resilience. A well-structured system could reduce the burden on our risk management teams and release capacity.

This challenge will improve clarity on how risk is processed and managed as well as help to track risk performance. Overall, any improvements to risk management can have a massive snowball effect, delivering improved timeliness, reduce costs and vastly improve quality.
