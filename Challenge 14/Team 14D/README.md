# Challenge Summary
These days we’re paperless.
Everything we write and communicate is stored digitally.
Microsoft SharePoint and Teams are among the most widely used electronic filing and collaboration systems worldwide.  These underpin many projects and programmes.
But a filing system isn’t just the files – it’s the meta-data: who wrote what, when?  Who modified it, and why?
These insights can power a new generation of PMO.  One where we can mine the data to understand our project performance, the degree to which our team collaborate, and the well-being of our teams.
This challenge is all about exploiting the vast exhaust plume of data our project filing and collaboration systems generate, to drive a cycle of continuous improvement that lifts our performance and project and programme value.
We’ll focus on Teams and SharePoint to get started, but the sky’s the limit!
