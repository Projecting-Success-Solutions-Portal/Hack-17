# Challenge Summary

At HS2 there are large portfolios of projects happening at any one time.

Ensuring that risks management is at the heart of the programme execution is necessary to ensure that any potential problems within a project are accounted for, and necessary steps are taken in order to mitigate that risk so that the process is robust and resilient.

Can insights on existing risk registers provide a view on how risks are identified and managed and also provide recommendations on process improvement to ensure that projects are delivered on time, on budget and to the highest possible standard?
