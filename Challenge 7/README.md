**Extreme Weather Optimisation Tool**

2025 PDA Vision Theme: Logistics

Type: 
Student friendly

Tools Used – Visualisation, Data Analysis, Optimisation


**Summary**
-  

Weather events have become more extreme and more detrimental over the last few years as a result of climate change. This carries a far greater risk to the safety of people on site as well as delays in the project plan and higher associated costs. In order to optimise how they delivery construction projects and how they manage assets, HS2 Ltd wants a tool that can provide real time insight into weather events so they can effectively manage decisions to optimise productivity, costs and safety.

**Pain Points**
-  
- Quickly inform site teams of weather risk and its implications in terms of activity thresholds
- Real time insight into weather risks
- Using more granular data (either temporarily or spatially) than general weather forecasting provides
- Providing evidence to inform optimised site management
- Allow users to define their own weather thresholds/metrics
- A scalable tool to manage weather data route wide
- Highlighting evolving emergency situations in real-time
- Evidencing actions taken to ensure resilience
- Usable for construction sites, environmental ‘green’ assets and operational ‘grey’ assets
- Automate as much as possible

**Outputs**
-  
The output for this challenge is a data analysis tool that allows users to set their own weather thresholds for reporting and activity optimisation. It should provide actionable insight to users and be adaptable and scalable across the HS2 route and activity phases from construction to operation. It should clearly highlight when a weather event begins and ends and should be focused on how data is presented in near real-time to allow automated, accessible and consistent decision making
