**Extreme Weather Optimisation Tool**

2025 PDA Vision Theme: 
Logistics

**Summary**

Weather events have become more extreme and more detrimental over the last few years as a result of climate change. This carries a far greater risk to the safety of people on site as well as delays in the project plan and higher associated costs. In order to optimise how they delivery construction projects and how they manage assets, HS2 Ltd wants a tool that can provide real time insight into weather events so they can effectively manage decisions to optimise productivity, costs and safety.

**Pain Points**

- Quickly inform site teams of weather risk and its implications in terms of activity thresholds
- Real time insight into weather risks
- Using more granular data (either temporarily or spatially) than general weather forecasting provides
- Providing evidence to inform optimised site management
- Allow users to define their own weather thresholds/metrics
- A scalable tool to manage weather data route wide
- Highlighting evolving emergency situations in real-time
- Evidencing actions taken to ensure resilience
- Usable for construction sites, environmental ‘green’ assets and operational ‘grey’ assets
- Automate as much as possible

**User Stories**

- As a member of an on-site team, I want to see live weather reports for my site, with analysis of the implications of that weather so that I can make informed decisions about safety and project tasks

- As a member of an operation team, I want to see live weather reports for my site, with analysis of the implications of that weather, So that I can make informed decisions on operational procedures to reduce delays and improve safety

- As a climate change manager, I want to understand how climate/weather affects project sites over time and what needs addressing, So that I can effectively report on climate resilience and enact changes in operations to ensure safety, productivity and resilience

- As a senior leader, I want to understand how weather is affecting my projects, So that I can make informed decision and have confidence on how weather events are addressed.

**Context**

HS2 is the UK’s flagship transport levelling up project. It is the biggest rail investment ever made in the North of England and is Europe’s largest infrastructure project. Major civil engineering works are now underway with £23 billion contracted into the supply chain and over 350 active sites between the West Midlands and London, supporting 27,000 jobs, delivering benefits before a single train has started running. The new high-speed line will run between the North West and the South East, stopping at Manchester, Birmingham and London with trains continuing on the existing network to Scotland and elsewhere.

HS2 is being designed to operate into the 22nd century, which includes making it resilient to our changing climate. As the new backbone for Britain’s transport network, it’s critical the railway can withstand extreme hot and cold weather, heavy rain, high winds and storms which are becoming more common.

HS2 needs a scalable solution (tool, model, interactive database, artificial intelligence (AI) etc.) to support the management of weather and climate information and risks to enable intelligence led decision making to delivery high levels of operational performance and safety. It should be scalable across the HS2 route, but also capture sufficient detail to inform decisions at a local level where applicable. It should aim to allow decision making at various temporal scales including near real-time decision making, short-term (i.e. weekly) planning and medium-term (i.e. seasonal) planning of activities. 

For this challenge we want you to use site weather data, national weather data and HS2 GIS data on both assets and project sites to develop a live weather optimisation tool for use on a geographically granular level. The purpose is to allow people working on a site to react quickly and effectively to extreme weather.

The tool will need to allow the user to input their own thresholds for weather warnings and metrics so that they can gain the right warnings and insight for their situation. For example, certain cranes will have limits to windspeeds they can operate at, concrete pouring activities can only take place above certain temperatures, in-person inspections will require greater levels of planning when temperatures are below certain thresholds etc.

This challenge will need to be scalable and adaptable to all areas of HS2, this means that it can be used on construction sites, environmental protection sites and operation sites in the future i.e. train stations and trackside. It is expected that teams should focus on the tool for optimising weather information itself.  Specific thresholds should be open for users to set themselves and the weather forecasting abilities of other providers should be harnessed where possible (although potentially optimised to provide site-specific information where needed). However, don’t let this restrict you in how you visualise the data and develop the challenge.

Additionally, there is room to explore how historical weather data might be used to improve reporting and decision making. Consider how managerial teams might track the data overtime to inform asset replacement cycles and insight on climate resilience, and how this can be used for further improvements in the future.

**Dataset Description**

You will be provided with weather sensor readings for specific sites from Align, as well as publicly available GIS data from HS2’s sites. You will need to match the sensor locations to the matching sites as well as create dummy thresholds for weather events.

**Outputs**

The output for this challenge is a data analysis tool that allows users to set their own weather thresholds for reporting and activity optimisation. It should provide actionable insight to users and be adaptable and scalable across the HS2 route and activity phases from construction to operation. It should clearly highlight when a weather event begins and ends and should be focused on how data is presented in near real-time to allow automated, accessible and consistent decision making.

**Benefits**

This challenge will have immediate benefits for users and most importantly greatly reduce personnel hours needed. With all the weather data being presented live and automatically people can respond immediately and with the right information. It will reduce cost, improve safety and improve efficiency.
The tool will also improve project performance, provide clarity to all those using it and guarantee consistency with both reporting and operations.
It will also provide assurance to senior leaders and management teams by clearly tracking and recording events, collating them for anyone that needs them.
