# Challenge Summary

Proactive risk management and opportunity realisation is vital to ensuring projects success. However, often the risk process is sluggish, overbearing, not accessible to all and not ‘live’. This challenge is about dramatically improving the agility of the risk process, by providing the project delivery community instant access to the latest risk content and the ability to update at any time. You will need to ensure the front-end is concise and intuitive, so it encourages proactive updates from project professionals, whilst the supporting database aggregates and filters the relevant data to produce forward looking risk dashboards, focussing attention on what truly needs to be done to mitigate risk or realise opportunities.
