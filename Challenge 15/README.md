**Integrated Risk App and Visualisation Solution**

2025 PDA Vision Theme: Risk Management

**Summary**

Proactive risk management and opportunity realisation is vital to ensuring projects success. However, often the risk process is sluggish, overbearing, not accessible to all and not ‘live’. This challenge is about dramatically improving the agility of the risk process, by providing the project delivery community instant access to the latest risk content and the ability to update at any time. You will need to ensure the front-end is concise and intuitive, so it encourages proactive updates from project professionals, whilst the supporting database aggregates and filters the relevant data to produce forward looking risk dashboards, focussing attention on what truly needs to be done to mitigate risk or realise opportunities.

**Pain Points**

- Risks are often only reviewed in periodic risk reviews and these reviews are often looking back i.e. rear-view mirror approach
- Registers are held either on a database or excel spreadsheet and only accessible to the risk professional
- Risk data is often out of date, with no consequence if due dates are missed
- Aggregation and roll-up of risk from project to programme/portfolio to corporate levels is often very manual
- Risk dashboards are often RAG/Top 5 outputs, which really don’t provide much value or call for action/decision from SLTs

**User Stories**

- As a risk management professional, I still need a level of control over a risk process but require a process that improves project wide engagement by enabling live updates or prompting when actions are due or risks are escalating through an accessible user interface portal. I still want assurance that data is collected and aggregated centrally, whilst having the ability to verify the data before dashboards are produced.

- As a project professional, I would like to input new risk data, update existing actions/risks, whenever and wherever I wish i.e. on site/on my commute. I would like discrete notifications when my responsibilities are due.

- As a project/programme leader, I want the latest risk management data that is forward looking, concise and articulates what is required to mitigate, manage or avoid risks, whilst considering opportunities for efficiencies, savings or acceleration.

**Context**
Gleeds Infrastructure are Gleeds’ fastest growing sector having tripled in size in the last two years. We are in full alignment with the ‘One Gleeds’ business initiative for digital transformation and innovation. As a result, our risk professionals are constantly challenging how data and digital solutions can not only improve driving efficiencies into a profession that has largely done the same thing for 15 years. We are fully supportive of the Project Hackathon’s and will be participating in Project:Hack17.

Our approach and solutions are centred around people engagement and about tailoring to client needs. It is never a case of one size fits all.

However, it is essential for Gleeds and our clients (both externally and internally) that we provide our teams with the best possible tools and techniques to do their role effectively and efficiently, providing them with the necessary time and availability to provide value-add interactions with stakeholders rather than manual-handling/double lifting processes.

**Dataset Description**

You will be provided with our latest risk register template, with a number of varying datasets to enable the development of a database, front-end app and then dashboards.
Please consider if the existing data fields are relevant or if additional data may be useful or necessary. Consider what other business use in their risk register and try to create a schema that is relevant to all infrastructure businesses.

**Outputs**

Ideally you would prepare a prototype of a new app/database/system that includes:
- User friendly interface, accessible on any device, easy to read data and visually engaging
- Database of risk information
- Forward looking risk dashboards
- Risk information quality assurance

Also consider a roadmap for implementation i.e trials, stakeholder engagement, data capture, assurance of solution, training required etc

We strongly recommend you develop this as a Model-Driven App, this means you will need to use DataVerse to define the structure before you build any application. This can still be adjusted later but it creates a very firm foundation for development and future iterations.

**Benefits**
The ultimate benefit is developing a proactive risk culture via the implementation of this solution that engages project professionals, drives concise risk data and produces risk dashboards that enable better decision making based on a single source of risk data. The solution could also improve data efficiency and integration of project controls elements for all using the app.
